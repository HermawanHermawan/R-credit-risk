PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project aims to model credit risk by using logistic regression and decision trees in R. The area of credit risk modeling itself is all about the event of loan default. When a bank grants a loan to a borrower, which could be an individual or a company, the bank will usually transfer the entire amount of the loan to the borrower. The borrower will then reimburse this amount in smaller chunks, including some interest payments, over time. Usually, these payments happen monthly, quarterly, or yearly. However, there is a certain risk that a borrower will not be able to fully reimburse this loan. This results in a loss for the bank. The expected loss a bank will incur is composed of three elements. The first element is the probability of default (PD), which is the probability that the borrower will fail to make a full repayment of the loan. This project focuses on building this PD model.
